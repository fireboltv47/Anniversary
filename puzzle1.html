        <h1>Puzzle 1: Our First Meeting</h1>
        <p>Well, here's clue 1, I'm coding this rn and my brain is muddled so kinda have no clue about what to write here as text lol, I was just kinda winging it and there are supposed to be heartfelt letters of love. I do hope you opened this in incognito lol. It's about our first meeting.</p>
        <p>I met you at the very start of our first year, although you don't remember it. I saw you in the atrium pehle. I was mesmerized. Later I met you face to face in the auditorium. The first few months were so weird, I wanted friends, I liked you initially but I also was shy and depressed and never came to college and aisa lagta tha ki everyone was becoming close and I was passing by everyone. You were so sweet tho, and at the time, you felt like proper royalty lol. I remember that day in Pablo and how pretty you looked, pehle mai kaam aata tha but I always admired you from how nice and friendly you were to me to your answers in PCT-1 to small talks initially. It was nice.</p>
        <p>I will probably make this too long aise lol, I'll be short, Open Envelope 1. Solve your puzzle. Enter the correct answer to proceed.</p>
        <input type="text" id="answer" placeholder="Enter your answer here">
        <br>
        <button class="btn" onclick="checkAnswer()">Submit</button>
