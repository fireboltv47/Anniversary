        <h1>Welcome to Our Anniversary Scavenger Hunt!</h1>
        <p>Dear Prawahika,</p>
        <p>For the sake of being inconspicuous I will write all instructions and letters on these webpages. The puzzles were supposed to be online website games and the letters offline. But after much planning and changes, it's best that all puzzles are offline and you will receive instructions online.</p>
        <p>Here are your instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Welcome to this journey down the past year, you gotta open envelopes when the webpage asks you to.</li>
            <li>Each Envelope will have a large number written on top of it. Only open the envelope that is asked on the page. In order 1, 2, 3 and so on.</li>
            <li>Each Envelope will contain 2 things: a puzzle and a gift for solving the last riddle that actually is connected to the puzzle.</li>
            <li>Solve the puzzles. Each puzzle will give you a word. Enter that into the page and click next to move forward.</li>
            <li>There are 12 gifts and 18 letters. They are all in sequence and tell a story.</li>
            <li>I realize now that this may be very frustrating or boring for you looooool, I guarantee I kept the riddles fun and easy and engaging and every single one is meaningful to our journey.</li>
            <li>Feel free to quit anytime, buckle in and enjoy the journey!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let's relive our memories and enjoy this adventure together. Click the button below to start your journey!</p>
